+ Avery Hillstrom
+ Last revised: 01/12/2024
+ Make a simple application that can hold a list of students and retain the data using SQLite. Must have 3 endpoints: One to add a student to the list, one to remove a student to the list, and one to read the current list of students. The student information displayed must include first name, last name, and hobby.
